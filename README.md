# Birthday app

Android App can be created using this code. Depending on the screen resolution, you might need to change the codes. 
The app includes a main screen showing the name of the person and a picture of that person.
Once the button is pressed, you'll be directed to a message window where you'll get two options to view the picture gallery or visit the songs app. 

Depending on the total number of pictures, the loading time for the app may vary and the app size may also vary accordingly.
